Measuring congestion typically involves analyzing traffic flow, travel times, vehicle counts, and other factors that affect the movement of vehicles through a transportation network. Here are some common methods and metrics used to measure congestion:

### 1. Road Based

- **Traffic Volume and Flow**
  - **Traffic Volume**: Counting the number of vehicles passing a point on a road over a certain period (e.g., vehicles per hour).
  - **Traffic Flow**: Measuring the rate at which vehicles pass a point (e.g., vehicles per lane per hour).

- **Road Density**: The number of vehicles per unit length of a road (e.g., vehicles per kilometer).
- **Congestion Duration**: The amount of time a roadway segment is congested during a day.
- **Peak Hour Factor (PHF)**: The ratio of the volume during the peak hour to the average volume during the peak period.

### 2. Vehicle Based
- **Travel Time and Delay**
  - **Travel Time**: The time it takes for a vehicle to travel from one point to another.
  - **Delay**: The difference between the actual travel time and the free-flow travel time (i.e., the time it would take with no congestion).
  - **Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)**: The total number of miles traveled by all vehicles within a specific area and time period.
- **Speed**: The average speed of vehicles on a roadway, often measured using GPS data from vehicles.
- **Lever of Service (LoS)**: A qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream, generally rated from A (free flow) to F (highly congested).
- **Congestion Indices**
  - **Travel Time Index (TTI)**: The ratio of travel time in congested conditions to travel time in free-flow conditions.
  - **Buffer Index (BI)**: The extra time (as a percentage) needed to ensure on-time arrival compared to average travel time.
  - **Planning Time Index (PTI)**: The total time needed to ensure on-time arrival 95% of the time compared to free-flow travel time.

### 3. Other

- **Incident Data**
  - **Incident Reports**: Data from accidents, roadworks, or other incidents that can cause congestion.
  - **Response Time**: The time taken to respond to and clear incidents.

- **Public Transport Data**
  - **Ridership Levels**: The number of passengers using public transport, which can indicate shifts in congestion.
  - **Bus and Train Delay Times**: Delays in public transport can reflect congestion levels on the roads.
